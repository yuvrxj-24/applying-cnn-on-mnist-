CNN Classification on MNIST Dataset

ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project demonstrates a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built with TensorFlow and Keras for classifying handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. The model is trained and evaluated using various performance metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, confusion matrix, and ROC-AUC.

ðŸ“‚ Dataset

MNIST Dataset: Consists of 70,000 grayscale images (28x28 pixels) of handwritten digits (0-9).

Train Set: 60,000 images

Test Set: 10,000 images

ðŸ“– Steps in the Project

Data Preprocessing

Normalize images (scale pixel values between 0 and 1)

Reshape data to match CNN input requirements

Convert labels to one-hot encoding
